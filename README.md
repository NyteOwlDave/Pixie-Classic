A very basic way to copy picture files from computer to flash drive (and vice-versa).

This is written in Visual Basic .Net (using Visual Studio 2015).

The application allows the user to easily bulk copy picture files from a folder to a
removable device (such as an SD Card or Flash Drive). They can also reverse this
operation. In other words, they can import or export a collection of picture files.

It's purpose is to make this process very easy for people who aren't very knowledgeable
about computers or how to use them.

It was written for a family member who does not care to learn a great deal about using
their computer, but loves to share pictures.

The source code is straight forward and easy to understand, so I won't go into details here.
